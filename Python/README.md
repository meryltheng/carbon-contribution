# Estimating the impact of myrtle rust on individual species

This subfolder contains code to estimate the impact myrtle rust on individual species, given ordinal ratings/scores (e.g., "Relatively Tolerant" or "Extremely Susceptible").

Briefly, it uses Approximate Bayesian Computation to estimate the shape of the damage/impact density curve, and estimate the location of the thresholds that separate "Relatively Tolerant" from "Moderately Susceptible" and so forth.
